          <hr>

          <p>
            <strong>Coffee cupping</strong>, or <i>coffee tasting</i>, is the practice of evaluating coffee quality by distinguishing between 
            different attributes, namely aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, sweetness, body and balance. The Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) 
            trains "Q graders" (quality graders) to test for these attributes, as well as uniformity, cleanness and defects. Scores 
            are then aggregated to grade the coffee on a 100-point scale. See the CQI Fine Robusta Cupping Form 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coffeeinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Robusta-Cupping-form_vFeb2019.jpg">here</a>.

                    The aromatic aspects include Fragrance (defined as the smell of the ground coffee when still dry) and Aroma 
                    (the smell of the coffee when infused with hot water). One can evaluate this at three distinct steps in the 
                    cupping process: (1) sniffing the grounds placed into the cup before pouring water onto the coffee; (2) sniffing 
                    the aromas released while breaking the crust; and (3) sniffing the aromas released as the coffee steeps. Specific 
                    aromas can be noted under "qualities" and the intensity of the dry, break, and wet aroma aspects noted on the 
                    5-point vertical scales. The score finally given should reflect the preference of all three aspects of a sample's 
                    Fragrance/Aroma.

                    Flavor represents the coffee's principal character, the "mid-range" notes, in between the first impressions 
                    given by the coffee's first aroma and acidity to its final aftertaste. It is a combined impression of all 
                    the gustatory (taste bud) sensations and retro-nasal aromas that go from the mouth to nose. The score given 
                    for Flavor should account for the intensity, quality and complexity of its combined taste and aroma, 
                    experienced when the coffee is slurped into the mouth vigorously so as to involve the entire palate in the 
                    evaluation.

                    unpleasant, a lower score would be given.

                    Acidity is often described as "brightness" when favorable or "sour" when unfavorable. At its best, acidity 
                    contributes to a coffee's liveliness, sweetness, and fresh- fruit character and is almost immediately 
                    experienced and evaluated when the coffee is first slurped into the mouth. Acidity that is overly intense 
                    or dominating may be unpleasant, however, and excessive acidity may not be appropriate to the flavor profile 
                    of the sample. The final score marked on the horizontal tick-mark scale should reflect the panelist's 
                    perceived quality for the Acidity relative to the expected flavor profile based on origin characteristics 
                    and/or other factors (degree of roast, intended use, etc.). Coffees expected to be high in Acidity, such as a 
                    Kenya coffee, or coffees expected to be low in Acidity, such as a Sumatra coffee, can receive equally high 
                    preference scores although their intensity rankings will be quite different.

                        The quality of Body is based upon the tactile feeling of the liquid in the mouth, especially as perceived 
                        between the tongue and roof of the mouth. Most samples with heavy Body may also receive a high score in 
                        terms of quality due to the presence of brew colloids and sucrose. Some samples with lighter Body may also 
                        have a pleasant feeling in the mouth, however. Coffees expected to be high in Body, such as a Sumatra coffee, 
                        or coffees expected to be low in Body, such as a Mexican coffee, can receive equally high preference scores 
                        although their intensity rankings will be quite different.

                                        perception is the result of the presence of certain carbohydrates. The opposite of sweetness 
                                        in this context is sour, astringency or “green” flavors. This quality may not be directly 
                                        perceived as in sucrose-laden products such as soft drinks, but will affect other flavor 
                                        attributes. 2 points are awarded for each cup displaying this attribute for a maximum score 
                                        of 10 points.

                                      Defects are negative or poor flavors that detract from the quality of the coffee. These are 
                                      classified in 2 ways. A taint is an off-flavor that is noticeable, but not overwhelming, usually 
                                      found in the aromatic aspects. A “taint” is given a “2” in intensity. A fault is an off-flavor, 
                                      usually found in the taste aspects, that is either overwhelming or renders the sample unpalatable 
                                      and is given an intensity rating of “4”. The defect must first be classified (as a taint or a fault), 
                                      then described (“sour,” “rubbery,” “ferment,” “phenolic” for example) and the description written down. 
                                      The number of cups in which the defect was found is then noted, and the intensity of the defect is 
                                      recorded as either a 2 or 4. The defect score is multiplied and subtracted from the total score 
                                      according to directions on the cupping form.

                                    The “overall” scoring aspect is meant to reflect the holistically integrated rating of the sample as 
                                    perceived by the individual panelist. A sample with many highly pleasant aspects, but not quite 
                                    “measuring up” would receive a lower rating. A coffee that met expectations as to its character and 
                                    reflected articular origin flavor qualities would receive a high score. An exemplary example of 
                                    preferred characteristics not fully reflected in the individual score of the individual attributes 
                                    might receive an even higher score. This is the step where the panelists make their personal appraisal.
